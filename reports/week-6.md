# Week 6 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Last Week's Agenda

    - (Pasted from last week) Next week will include multiple individual contributions. For front end, the team is going to be working on implementing all of the question templates and components. Likewise, we will also have a preliminary design done for UI that the front end team will reference once the component functionality is completed. Content will also start being written that the front end team will utilize in the form of static fake data. The backend team will begin implementation of the infrastructure mentioned in living doc.

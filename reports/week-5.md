# Week 5 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Last Week's Agenda

    - First week of status reports, empty for now (as permitted by assignment spec).

2. Progress

    - During this week, we updated our living doc and made necessary additions and edits. Likewise, we have also all individually advanced towards our schedule including implementing a couple of the front end components, creating the template for content, and discussing the infrastructure for backend (individual contributions can be referenced below). Basic backend setup was also done.


3. Next Week's Agenda

    - Next week will include multiple individual contributions. For front end, the team is going to be working on implementing all of the question templates and components. Likewise, we will also have a preliminary design done for UI that the front end team will reference once the component functionality is completed. Content will also start being written that the front end team will utilize in the form of static fake data. The backend team will begin implementation of the infrastructure mentioned in living doc.

## Team Member Contributions

1. Last Week's Agenda

    - First week of status reports, empty for now (as permitted by assignment spec).

2. Progress

    - JP Gabriel:

    - Jason Gao: Wrote out the project architecture section of the living doc, with input from other team members. Created a diagram with the help of Jason Xu.
    Set up initial Node.js backend with Express, and set up build scripts for compiling, cleaning, and running the backend with hot-reloads.

    - Jason Xu: Pair programmed with Jason Hua and started creating some react components. We started a testing environment and implemented react-router. We then completed the components and pages necessary for multiple choice.

    - Jason Hua: Worked on frontend components, prototypes of the navBar and multiple choice have been completed.

    - Evan Kim: Worked on risk assessment and project schedule for the living doc.

    - Winston Bullen: Decided content formatting with the team. Content will be stored in json files for now. They will have a flexible structure to account for different types of questions. This structure is pre-determined according to what front end would like to receive.

3. Next Week's Agenda

    - JP Gabriel:

    - Jason Gao: Design the API for clients to receive content and authenticate and implement it in Node. Write interfaces and basic classes
    including the interface between the business layer and database layer.

    - Jason Xu: Programming other components (Drag and Drag + Short Answer) with Jason Hua and Evan.

    - Jason Hua: Finish question design components such as drag and drop and short answer questions. Develop a UI Design for all questions

    - Evan Kim: Working on finishing front end question components (drag and drop + short answer). Work on question submit/verify answer logic.

    - Winston Bullen: Draft several versions of these json files to start skeleton testing. This ensures the format is adequate for front end. Once the format is finalized, draft the rest of the content for release.

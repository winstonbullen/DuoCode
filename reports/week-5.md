# Week 5 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Last Week's Agenda

    - First week of status reports, empty for now (as permitted by assignment spec).

2. Progress

    - During this week, we updated our living doc and made necessary additions and edits. Likewise, we have also all individually advanced towards our schedule including implementing a couple of the front end components, creating the template for content, and discussing the infrastructure for backend (individual contributions can be referenced below).


3. Next Week's Agenda

    - Next week will include multiple individual contributions. For front end, the team is going to be working on implementing all of the question templates and components. Likewise, we will also have a preliminary design done for UI that the front end team will reference once the component functionality is completed. Content will also start being written that the front end team will utilize in the form of static fake data. The backend team will begin implementation of the infrastructure mentioned in living doc.

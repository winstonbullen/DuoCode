# DuoCode

DuoCode is a code learning app that is inspired by Duolingo. It is targeted towards those who are less experienced, but can cater to all levels. 

Existing resources fail to make coding practice exciting and accessible across all devices. DuoCode was conceived with the intention of filling this gap.

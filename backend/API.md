  - `GET /content/java/arrays/drag_drop/d1_1.json`
- Both examples return the same result, which varies depending on type of question:
```json
{
    "language": "java",
    "subject": "arrays",
    "type": "drag_drop",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "prompt": "Drag and drop the following blocks to create an empty int array of length 8 called myInts.",
    "correct_ordering": ["int[]", "myInts", "=", "new", "int[8]", ";"]

flexible to changes in the way that question content is hosted.

    <h2>How-to</h2>
    <a href="/signup">Sign up</a> or <a href="/login">Sign in</a> to get started! DuoCode is accessible via the web and can be used on any device with a browser. Signing in will redirect to a homepage containing the list of units. Each unit contains three exercises ordered by difficulty. Click on a blue star icon to try one out!

    <br>
    Each exercise has a prompt that includes a technical coding question. There are three of these questions per exercise. Try your best!
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, there is a milestone quiz at the end of the three exercises. The milestone contains three random short response questions from that unit. Complete it to finish the unit. No pressure!

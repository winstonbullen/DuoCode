## Communication

Primary communication via team Slack channel with the following general policies:

- Tag team members with an @ if you need to directly communicate with them so Slack sends them an email notification. 

- Send a message in the chat if you are going to be absent for any team meeting, and preferrably provide a brief status report to keep the team in the loop.

- Notify absent team members from team meetings with an @ mention, a meeting summary, and their action items.
